		      		Well, a number of reasons really, but they all hover around a common goal. I spent the first half of my 20â€™s travelling around Oceania and Southeast Asia where I had some fantastic, unique experiences. I was using websites like <a href="http://www.helpx.net" target="_blank">helpx</a>, <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com" target="_blank">couchsurfing</a> and <a href="http://www.wwoof.com.au/" target="_blank">wwoof</a> to seek out less travelled areas of these countries and was really blown away by the results. By far my  favourite experiences were found this way, and it gave me the opportunity to experiment with a money-free lifestyle. It has become a goal of mine to create something that allows even more people to enjoy this way of living, and I believe I can achieve this through Web Development.

		      		Over quite a few years, I followed various free courses online, such as <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com" target="_blank">Code School</a>. They got me to a certain level, but it wasn't until I completed my course at <a href="http://www.careerfoundry.com" target="_blank">Career Foundry</a> that I really felt like a true programmer.
